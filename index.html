<h1> Creating an open-access platform for sharing secondary chemistry resources</h1>
<body>
  <p>I am using this repository to share my research journey.
I am part of the SCOPE (Science, Communication, Outreach, Participation and Education) research group. We're a team of open source research students, post-docs and academics, who combine multi-disciplinary research and experience to develop better resources, practices and general approaches to science engagement.
    SCOPE is based in the School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney, Australia.</p>
