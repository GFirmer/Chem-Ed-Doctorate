<h1>What do we know about learning in each area of chemistry?</h1>
<body>
<p>I am interested in finding out which areas of chemistry education we have strong bodies of literature for, and which we don't.</p>
<p>I will start off by looking at learning progressions, misconceptions and teaching suggestions in each area of chemistry</p>
<p>I hope that this will highlight areas of chemistry that need more work and thought in a quickly accessible way</p>
