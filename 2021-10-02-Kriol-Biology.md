<h4>Reflection by Genevieve Firmer</h4>
<h4>Resources by Rickane Shark and Edwina Murphy</h4>

<h6>I would like to acknowledge the Jawoyn, Dagoman, Wardaman and Miali people, the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which this work was conducted, and where the authors lived at the time these resources were created. I wish to pay my respects to their Elders past and present.</h6>

<h6>In Kriol, the name for the place on which this work was conducted is Katharrain. In English, it is Katherine.</h6>



<p>In this article, I would like to reflect on my experience as a non-Indigenous teacher facilitating the introduction of an Indigenous language into the senior science classroom. I hope that it demonstrates the power of two-way learning and the importance of supporting students to learn in, and share, their languages. </p>

<h5><a href="https://github.com/GFirmer/Chemistry-teacher/blob/master/Supporting%20materials%20The%20Human%20Body%20in%20Kriol%20and%20English.pdf">Here you can look through the resources that were created by two Indigenous students in my class, Rickane Shark and Edwina Murphy.</a></h5><p>  These resources were created by them in a two-way dialogue with me, their biology teacher, as part of a science communication task.</p>

<p>I also recognise that I am still learning. I am a young, white teacher with a lot to learn, a lot to unlearn, and a lot that I want to say but don’t yet know how to say. If you have any feedback about anything I have raised, or the way I have raised it in my reflection, I would be very grateful to hear from you.</p>


<h3>The task</h3>

<p>The class was a small group of diverse learners, and the first topic on organ systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, excretory, digestive) for year 11 biology was largely revision. Instead of teaching the content explicitly, I allowed the students to work independently, researching each organ system that was prescribed and a disease of their choice associated with that system. The task focussed then on their ability to communicate their findings creatively to a particular audience. I noticed that student buy-in to the task was significantly increased when they were given the ability to choose their topic. The independent work also gave me freedom to spend time with each student individually, encouraging them to find out about diseases that were of interest to them and building rapport early on in the course. In addition, the students were able to discuss methods of research, communication and content amongst themselves. Programming this task early in the year provided a good opportunity for me to understand how proficient their research, writing, communication and independent work skills were.</p>

<p>The setup of this task in having students working independently allowed me to create a learning environment where students were able to learn in a way that contributed to the goals were are important to them. This task could be easily shaped to encourage students considering undertaking science courses at university to start thinking about the cellular mechanisms of organ function and disease. It could also be shaped to provide practical information which may be useful for students wanting to support their families and people in their communities to better understand relevant health issues. Organ systems are a critical building block for science and health literacy, in particular, understanding the cause and progression of diseases that affect these systems. This topic is a strong starting point for helping students to appreciate the importance of communicating science clearly.</p>

<h3>Creating health resources in Kriol</h3>

<p>For two of my students, Edwina and Rickane, English is not their first or even second language. The language they speak predominantly at home is Kriol, and it is a language that is understood by most Indigenous peoples in the Katherine region and beyond, with Kriol speakers living as far away as northern Western Australia and northern Queensland (with regional variations). I have been privileged enough to have had some opportunities to learn Kriol, both formally and in conversation with my students. Edwina and Rickane expressed an interest in using this task to create resources in Kriol that could be useful for their family members and people in their communities, so we decided to work together to create some resources to that end.</p>

<p>The resource creation began in a two-way conversation between myself, Rickane and Edwina, with the students initially needing a significant amount of support to translate biological terminology into Kriol. I knew enough Kriol to be able to encourage them in the right direction, and the fact that they could laugh at me making mistakes, helped them to feel comfortable enough to take risks themselves. </p>

<p>Despite my students being proficient in both Kriol and English, having both attended English-speaking schools for over ten years, I was surprised at how hard it initially was to move between the two languages. One of the biggest challenges for Kriol speakers who have not grown up speaking English as a first language, is that in most Australian schools we do not explicitly teach English as an additional language or teach the skills involved in code switching. The students pick this up themselves, creating their own frameworks for translation. This is in itself an incredibly difficult task for which students are rarely acknowledged. Without an explicit acknowledgement that these students are learning a new language as well as the curriculum, students may not understand why they find school more difficult to understand than peers who have English as their first language. This can lead to decreased confidence, which can have a snowball effect on students’ self-concept, engagement, behaviour and academic outcomes.</p>

<p>As we worked through the first organ system, the confidence of both students grew immensely, and they increasingly required less support from me. I would like to thank Denise Angelo for giving us access to the booklet: Health – An Aid for Kriol interpreters (Hancock et al., 1995) which was a useful starting point for many body parts. Denise, along with linguists Greg Dickson and Jackie van den Bos, supported us with reviewing spelling and sentence structure as well as invaluable encouragement. </p>

<p>When we were addressing the diseases, the students conducted online research in English, and summarised the information in plain language. In many instances due to the technical terminology online, the students needed my support with the conversion to plain English. Then, the translation into Kriol was a two-way dialogue. It involved one of the three authors proposing a translation and discussion about the merits and disadvantages of different translations. In some cases, Rickane and Edwina took our ideas home and discussed the options with other family members.</p>

<h3>Improved scientific literacy</h3>

<p>The most noticeable impact of this task was that both students moved from a superficial understanding of organ systems, towards an in-depth understanding of the microscopic and cellular processes involved in their functioning and in disease. As they are too small to see even with a microscope, nephrons (parts of the kidney which filter blood) are quite difficult for many students to understand. However, after we had worked through the translation process both students could confidently explain the function of nephrons, and apply that understanding to explain how diabetes can lead to kidney damage and the process of dialysis. To my mind, this was a clear indicator that the English language had been a barrier to understanding, and that learning in a home language can result in deeper understanding. The students were motivated by the excitement of understanding these health issues in detail, and this realisation that they were capable of understanding to this depth led to increased confidence. The fact that both students have since flagged an interest in health careers may be a further testament to the success here.</p>

<p>We displayed the poster of the digestive system on the wall of the classroom, and observations of younger Kriol speaking students taking the time to read the poster spoke volumes to the potential impact of using resources in Traditional Languages as teaching tools. One student in particular who has difficulties with reading in English and often thus avoids the task, spent a significant period of time reading the poster on the wall. He was extremely proud of the work the older students had done and approached me to ask follow-up questions afterwards. This resource had a powerful impact on this student, as it has helped him to understand health concerns in his personal and family life.</p>

<h3>Benefits to English literacy</h3>

<p>This task resulted in both students improving their English language proficiency. The students learned a significant number of new words in English, both technical terms important for health literacy and more common terms that no one had explained to them before. This raises an important question about how learning through home languages in the classroom can actually support students’ English language proficiency.</p>

<p>By the end of the task, the students were able to translate English to Kriol and Kriol back to English more confidently. Many Australian healthcare, legal and other important systems are in need of Traditional Language interpreters. By building skills in science communication and integrating other languages, we are producing direct benefits for job related skills.</p>

<h3>Kriol literacy</h3>

<p>The third area in which I noted improvement was the students’ ability to read and write in Kriol. From some angles, this is a positive improvement and has direct effects on the students’ abilities to read and write in English. However, Kriol is predominantly an oral language, and as such producing resources in written forms is arguably not meeting the needs of the intended audience – a key part of good science communication. I believe that this was partly a reflection of my experience as a scientist and teacher. It was hard for me to guide the students to create resources in non-written forms, given this is predominantly how scientists (me included) are trained to communicate in science. As students gain confidence in themselves and trust in their teachers, I hope that they will be able and willing to share with us their perspectives on the best way to communicate scientific ideas to their communities and in incorporating Traditional Languages in the classroom. More work needs to be done to re-imagine science communication in non-Western contexts. I believe that our role as teachers is to work with our students in a way that allows them to guide us in this process of change.</p>

<h3>Benefits to community</h3>

<p>The students emphasised to me the importance of these resources in helping people in their communities understand these critical health issues. They have lived experience of the challenges faced by communities when communication with healthcare professionals breaks down and are passionate about using their skills to support their communities. The complex reasons why cross-cultural communication and education in Australia is largely not working, and the devastating impacts of these challenges on the health of Aboriginal communities, are outlined in the book Why Warriors lie down and die (Trudgen, 2015). As teachers, we have an important role to play in ensuring the next generation has the confidence to share their ideas and perspectives on the issues that are important to them. The resources we created in this context are an example of a way teachers can get students involved and thinking about these issues and how they would like to contribute, as well as giving them an opportunity to build the confidence and skills they will need to live their dreams.</p>

<h3>Two-way learning</h3>

<p>A wonderful outcome of this task was the vast amount that I learned during the process. I learned words and phrases in Kriol, and improved sentence structure. I also came to understand in more depth the challenges my Kriol speaking students face at school. This experience has led me to believe that every teacher should make an effort to try and learn the language of the area they are teaching in, so they can understand exactly what it is like to learn a new language and better understand their students’ lived experiences. </p>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank all of the students who have taken the time to teach me about their languages and culture. </p>

<p>I should add, however, that the jury is still out on whether my students think that teachers should learn their languages. At the start, sharing their strengths and culture is exciting. But my students report not always enjoying the consequences when teachers can understand too much of what they say to each other. We need to be careful that our quest to learn doesn’t result in language being used in ways that are not safe for its speakers. There is a risk that they will feel a pressure or burden to act as a cultural or literal translator, and an awareness of the complex position you hold as a teacher is important. I believe that the best approach is one that is guided by the communities, guardians and students in question. Taking the time to get to know your students and build student-teacher relationships involving genuine trust and mutual understanding is critical.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Australian Languages can and should be part of Australian schooling. This project is just one example of where the inclusion of a Traditional Language the learning experience for students and improved their understanding of key science concepts as well as their English language skills more broadly. Projects which allow students to see how they can be active in shaping the community they want to see in the future are invaluable. As educators, it is time to start thinking about how we can share these types of ideas and build these into our everyday practice. </p>
