<p>For this task, students were given free choice to design and conduct a scientific investigation related to our topic of microorganisms. The best thing about being a teacher is working with great students, particularly when they bring fresh, creative and innovative ideas about solving complex problems into the classroom. When the idea about investigating something to do with local Indigenous knowledge came up in discussions, Tahnee enthusiastically took on the challenge. She consulted a book we had in the classroom about medicinal plants in the region and started a conversation with Ozzie Daylight, a traditional owner of the nearby Elsey Station, whom she has known through her family connections for many years. Tahnee brought all this information together to design the scientific investigation presented below about the anti-bacterial properties of a selection of local plants.</p>

<p>Infectious diseases are increasingly becoming a burden on society and the exploration of natural products for new potential drug molecules is more important than ever. Tahneeâ€™s project is a beautiful example of how students with diverse backgrounds can help to unlock information about natural products which may hold the key for scientific breakthroughs. Tahnee has used the strength of her family connections to navigate the process of community engagement in a way that is responsive to traditional owners and community.</p>

<p>This work is also a demonstration of how secondary students can use the existing frameworks for year 11-12 scientific investigation assessments to utilise contemporary scientific practices in the investigation of Indigenous knowledges. These skills are critical for progress to be made in the genuine engagement of First Nations peoples in scientific research, and projects like this allow students to see themselves and their strengths reflected in the curriculum.</p>

<p>This piece has been presented exactly as it was submitted it for a year 11 biology assignment as an authentic example of the work that students can achieve in a school environment. Permission has been granted by Tahnee and her family to share this work. Small sections of information have been withheld to protect the traditional knowledge shared with the student in confidence.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Ozzie for his willingness to work with Tahnee on this project and thank Tahnee and her family for agreeing to share this work publicly. Thanks also to Jesse King for the support in readying this piece for submission.</p>

<h6>I would like to acknowledge the Jawoyn, Dagoman, Wardaman and Miali people, the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which this work was conducted, and where the authors lived at the time this project was completed.</h6>
