<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<h3>To my PhD research repository, where I will share my work on science education in Australia.</h3>

<p>My name is Genevieve Firmer and I am an energetic science educator that loves to play with new ideas about engaging students in learning. I have experience teaching F-10 science and STEM, senior chemistry and biology and in curriculum leadership. I am currently working on my PhD in Chemistry Education as part of the <a href="https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE">SCOPE Group</a>, where I am focussing on how curriculum influences classroom practice. From this research, I am hoping to develop evidence-based, open-access teaching & learning resources for senior chemistry.</p>

<p>I am using this repository and website to share my research journey. Below I have hyperlinked some of the areas I've started to share my work in. Please feel free to have a browse. If you have any queries, ideas or feedback, please get in touch via the discussions tab.</p>

<h2>SCOPE Research Group</h2>

I am part of the [SCOPE (Science, Communication, Outreach, Participation and Education)](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE) research group. We're a team of open source research students, post-docs and academics, who combine multi-disciplinary research and experience to develop better resources, practices and general approaches to science engagement. Our work is open source so please have a browse. To have a look at more of the work we do, head on over to the group [wiki](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE/wiki) to find information about us and the projects we are working on.

SCOPE is based in the [School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney, Australia.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-chemistry.html)
