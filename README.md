Creating an open-access platform for sharing secondary chemistry resources 

I am using this repository to share my research journey. 

I am part of the SCOPE (Science, Communication, Outreach, Participation and Education) research group. We're a team of open source research students, post-docs and academics, who combine multi-disciplinary research and experience to develop better resources, practices and general approaches to science engagement. 

Our work is open source so please have a browse :smiley: To have a look at more of the work we do, head on over to the [wiki](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE/wiki) to find information about us and the projects we are working on.

SCOPE is based in the School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney, Australia.
