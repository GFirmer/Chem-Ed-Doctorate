I am a senior secondary teacher specialising in Chemistry and Biology. I have experience teaching in the Northern Territory and am now working on my Masters of Philosophy in Science, focussing on secondary Chemistry education.

In my Masters I am working towards creating an open-access platform for sharing secondary chemistry resources. 

I am using this repository and website to share my research journey.

I am part of the [SCOPE (Science, Communication, Outreach, Participation and Education)](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE) research group. We're a team of open source research students, post-docs and academics, who combine multi-disciplinary research and experience to develop better resources, practices and general approaches to science engagement. Our work is open source so please have a browse. To have a look at more of the work we do, head on over to the group [wiki](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE/wiki) to find information about us and the projects we are working on.

SCOPE is based in the [School of Chemistry at the University of Sydney, Australia.](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-chemistry.html)
