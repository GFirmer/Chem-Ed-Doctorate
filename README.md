<h1>Welcome!</h1>

My name is Genevieve Firmer.

I am a science educator with experience in secondary teaching and curriculum leadership; currently on hiatus from classroom life while I explore ways to support amazing yet sustainable teaching practice.

In the research world, I am in the midst of completing a PhD that looks into how curriculum is made, and how it influences teaching practice in senior chemistry. I'm also working with schools to investigate how citizen science projects such as Breaking Good can be integrated into science classes to create a more relevant and engaging experience with chemistry and biology, and with incredible musicians in the Nanosonic Stories team to see how creative we can possibly be in the science classroom.

And in the education world, I work as a facilitator and science specialist with Future Anything, where we partner with young people, educators and schools to transform passion and curiosity into innovative ideas that make their world a better place.
