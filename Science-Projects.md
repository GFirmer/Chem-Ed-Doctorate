If you're interested in working with me to create a bespoke, in-curriculum science project for your class, this is work I do with [Future Anything](https://futureanything.com/). 
Please book in a time to chat: https://calendly.com/fa-gen/interested-in-science-programs

Coming soon to this page - sharing a year 10 science project which allows students to pick one area of science they love, and dive deeply.
