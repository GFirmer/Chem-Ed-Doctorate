<h1>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures</h1>
<h2>Opportunities in the Australian Science Curriculum</h2>

<p>Below I will share some of the work I did while teaching in Katherine, Northern Territory. I hope that by sharing these learning activities and my reflections on them, I can contribute to the conversation: How can we better support Indigenous students in schools and classrooms?</p>

<p>Where I am sharing the work of my students, I will name them as authors with their personal and guardian's permission.</p>
  
<h3><a href="https://gfirmer.github.io/Chemistry-teacher/Kriol-Biology">Using Kriol to learn Biology</a></h3>
<p>I reflect on the motivations for, process and impact of working with two Kriol speaking students to translate information about organ systems and diseases of those systems from English to Kriol as part of a science communication task.</p>

<h3><a href="https://gfirmer.github.io/Chemistry-teacher/Antibiotic-plants-Jawoyn">Antibiotic Plants in the Jawoyn Region</a></h3>
<p>I share a scientific report prepared by a year 11 student who consulted a Jawoyn Traditional Owner in her community to identify candidates for an investigation about the antibacterial properties of local plants. This work was completed as part of a Stage 1 Deconstruct and Design task.</p>
