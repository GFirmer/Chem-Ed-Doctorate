  <li>Scientific knowedlge can be used to develop and evaluate projected economic, social and environmental impacts</li>
  <li>Scientific knowledge can be used to design action for sustainability</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h4>Science has impacts and consequences</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The use of scientific knowledge may be beneficial or harmful</li>
  <li>The use of scientific knowledge may have unintended consequences</li>
</ul>
