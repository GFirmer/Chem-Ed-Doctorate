<h1>List of topics covered in Year 11 & 12 Chemistry in Australia</h1>


<p>All of the science disciplines in the Australian Curriculum are constructed with three intergrated and interconnected strands: Science Understanding, Science Inquiry Skills and Science as a Human Endeavour. The cross-curriculum priorities and general capabilities are also intended to be taught in an integrated way in all subjects. This page is a summary of the key ideas found in at least one of the state or national curricula.

<h2>Science as a Human Endeavour</h2>

<h4>Models & Theories/The Scientific Process</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How are models developed over time?</li>
  <li>How are theories developed over time?</li>
  <li>Models and theories are developed based on a range of evidence</li>
  <li>What are the uses and limitations of chemical knowledge in a range of contexts?</li>
  <li>Science relies on reproducibility</li>
  <li>Scientific knowledge can allow scientists to offer valid explanations</li>
  <li>Scientific knowledge can allow scientists to make reliable predictions</li>
  <li>Models and theories are contested, refined and replaced over time as new evidence challenges them or new models/theories have stronger explanatory power</li>
  <li>Science can be limited in its ability to provide definitive answers</li>
  <li>Definitive answers are not possible if insufficient reliable data is available</li>
  <li>Interpretation of data may be open to question</li>
</ul>

<h4>Science Communication</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Science relies on clear communication</li>
  <li>Science contributes to public debate but cannot always provide definitive answers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration in Science</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Science is a global enterprise.</li>
  <li>Science relies on international conventions</li>
  <li>Science relies on peer review</li>
  <li>Models and theories are developed based on evidence from a range of sources</li>
  <li>Models and theories are developed from multiple individuals</li>
  <li>International collaboration is often required for large-scale science projects</li>
  <li>International collaboration is often required for addressing issues in the Asia-Pacific Region</li>
</ul>

<h4>Science is multidisciplinary</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Models and theories are developed based on evidence from multiple disciplines</li>
  <li>Advances in science understanding in one field can influence other areas of science, technology and engineering</li>
</ul>

<h4>Science and Society</h4>
<ul>
  <li>How does chemical knowledge interact with social, economic, cultural and political considerations?</li>
  <li>The use of scientific knowledge is influenced by social, economic, cultural and ethical considerations</li>
  <li>The acceptance and use of scientific knowlegde can be influenced by social, economic and cultural contexts</li>
  <li>Scientific knowledge can be used to develop and evaluate projected economic, social and environmental impacts</li>
  <li>Scientific knowledge can be used to design action for sustainability</li>
</ul>

<h4>Science has impacts and consequences</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The use of scientific knowledge may be beneficial or harmful</li>
  <li>The use of scientific knowledge may have unintended consequences</li>
  <li>People can use scientific knowledge to inform the monitoring, assessment and evaluation of risk</li>
</ul>

<h4>Science and Technology</h4>
<ul>
  <li>ICT and other technologies have increased the size, accuracy and geographic and temporal scope of data sets with which scientists work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cross-curriculum Priorities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures</li>
  <li>Australia and Australia's Engagement with Asia</li>
  <li>Sustainability</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Capabilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Literacy</li>
  <li>Numeracy</li>
  <li>Information and Communication Technology Capability</li>
  <li>Critical and Creative Thinking</li>
  <li>Personal and Social Capability</li>
  <li>Ethical Understanding</li>
  <li>Intercultural Understanding</li>
</ul>
